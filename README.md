# wokaine's GitHub
The purpose of this GitHub is to (sometimes) store coursework and projects. Basically a public archive.

## About
I’m currently a third year student studying MEng (Integrated) Software Engineering at The University of Sheffield.

Criticism is always appreciated. I do not consider myself a good programmer, so feel free to tell me my code sucks because it probably does.
