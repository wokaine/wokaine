- @wokaine
- I’m interested in game development and learning how to code properly.
- I’m currently studying MEng Software Engineering at the University of Sheffield (1st year). I am learning Java, Ruby, Bash/CLI, HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript. 
- No need to reach out to me for collaboration at the moment, I am using GitHub as a place to store my completed projects.
- Criticism is always appreciated. I do not consider myself a good programmer.
