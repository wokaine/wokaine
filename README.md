# wokaine's epic GitHub
The purpose of this GitHub is to (sometimes) store coursework and projects. Basically a public archive.

## About
I’m currently a first year student studying MEng (Integrated) Software Engineering at the University of Sheffield. I am learning Java, Ruby, HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript. As well as Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara and SQL for a Ruby web application project (on GitLab).

Criticism is always appreciated. I do not consider myself a good programmer, so feel free to tell me my code sucks because it probably does.
